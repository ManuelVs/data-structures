# Data Structures

Some custom implementations of famous data structures in C++.  
My intention is to implement usable data structures and provide a similar interface to the STL.  
Also, I want to provide useful Unit Test and comparison benchmarks between my implementation and g++ implementation, using GoogleTest and GoogleBenchmarks C++ libraries.

You can see my progress in [this Trello board](https://trello.com/b/fksOG6A9/data-structures).

## Heaps

The heaps implemented in this library has the following interface:
- Template class for each heap, allowing key type, comparator and allocator.
- Default constructor, copy constructor and move constructor
- Copy and move assignement operators
- Swap operation
- Push by copy and move
- Emplace
- Top element
- Pop element
- Size and empty methods
